# Ledger

## Goal

Explore the design and implementation of simple languages. Inspired by PL/0.

## Key decisions
- Keep languages small
- PL/0 grammar variants project (e0 through e6)
- Concepts/grammar should be familiar across variants/level
- Koka-based interpreters, C++ interpreter/compiler, and perhaps also other implementation languages

## Additional decisions/constraints/assumptions
- Currently using PEG grammars
- Each language level/variant should have an code example file.
    - This example file should: 1) Demonstrate new functionality if not done by step 2. 2) Demonstrate how to express/encode features from the next level using only the current level's primitives (if possible).

## State
- Files organized into `src`, `examples`, `docs`, `test`, and `old`.
- Grammars reside in `src/`.
- e0 has a grammar (13 lines) and minimal interpreter (`e0peg.koka`, 99 lines)
- e1 has a grammar and working interpreters/compilers:
  - `e1peg.koka` (382 lines) — single-phase PEG interpreter
  - `e1.koka` — two-phase Koka interpreter
  - `e1.cpp` — C++ interpreter
  - `e1_compile.cpp` (112 lines) — unified C++/LLVM compiler
- Stack-based bigint runtime (`e1_rt_bigint_stack.cpp`) — no heap allocation
- C++ implementations support configurable integer widths via `e1.hpp`
- Factorial benchmark: C++ backend 17ms, LLVM backend 17ms, lli 77ms
- Other levels (e2 through e6) have PEG grammars and examples but no interpreters

## Next
- Restructure directories by language level (e0/, e1/, e2/, ... + shared/)
  - Each level gets its own directory with grammar, implementations, examples, docs
  - Shared code (peg.koka, bigint runtime) in shared/
  - Pros: clear ownership, easier to add levels, level-specific docs with code
  - Cons: more directories, Makefile complexity
  - Consider hybrid: keep src/ flat, split examples by level
- Add memoization to PEG semantic-action mode (thread memo table through peg-exec-match)
- Support for "syntactic sugar"?
- Explore papers about efficient interpreters.
  - Test Graal/Truffle
  - Plan some adoptions towards a more efficient implementation
  - Simple JIT?
- Continue with other grammar/interpreter work
- Standard library?
- Support for symbolic expressions (as in computer algebra systems)?
- Testing with a tool like llvm-stress (and llvm-reduce)
- Perhaps a seprate project: "Agent DSL": Use LLMs and tools as operators and add memory and parallel control flow. VALIDATE/RETRY clause. Linda-style parallelism for sharing context information?

## Now

### Working set (current focus only; replace/prune as "Now" changes)
- `src/e2peg.koka` — e2 interpreter (done)
- `src/e2.peg` — e2 grammar with inline actions (done)

## Done (prune when exceeding 30 items)
- Created e2peg.koka interpreter with case/break/comparison/mul-div support
- Added inline actions to e2.peg grammar
- Fixed PPlus in peg.koka to collect all children (was only keeping first)
- Added Makefile targets: koka-peg2, src/e2peg, bench (renamed from bench-1)
- Created e2 examples: factorial.e2, gcd.e2, collatz.e2
- Updated README.md and docs/IMPLEMENTATIONS.md with e2 info
- Renamed pl0_N languages to eN ("e" for experiment/exploration)
  - Renamed all files: .peg, .cpp, .hpp, .koka, docs
  - Updated all references in docs, examples, and source
- Added inline action support for suffix operators (*, +, ?)
  - `{ Block }` at end of sequence wraps star's children
  - Action table now empty — all semantics via inline actions + default-action
  - Documented future fold syntax consideration in PEG_SPEC.md
- Added inline actions to PEG grammar with expression language
  - Syntax: pattern { Cons($capture) }
  - Moved int_lit, ident, binding, print, break, loop to inline actions
  - Semantics now partially in grammar, not just Koka code
- Added named captures to PEG (`n:pattern` syntax) for binding sub-matches
- Created `docs/E1_SPEC.md` — language specification for e1
- Added error handling section to `docs/IMPLEMENTATIONS.md`
- Explored parse errors in dead code (`examples/test_dead_code*.e1`):
  - C++ interpreter is STRICT: tokenizes all → parses all → executes (fails on any invalid char)
  - Koka interpreters are LENIENT: tolerate trailing garbage
  - e1 uses `many(pstmt)` which silently stops on parse failure
  - e1peg reports parse failure but continues
- How to apply e1.hpp config to Koka: Moved to "Open questions" - not urgent
- Bigint reallocations for assignments: double capacity when too small, renamed runtime files (removed "_stack" suffix)
- Changed stacksave/restore from per-loop to per-allocation
  - Resolves dynamic sizing conflict: restore happens after copy, so variable buffers are safe
  - No performance impact (intrinsics are essentially free)
- Optimized bigint runtime: uint32_t size, bool neg, cleaner code
  - LLVM backend now matches C++ backend (17ms vs 17ms)
- Removed `e1_rt_bigint_stack.ll` from git, added to .gitignore (generated by Makefile)
- Modernized `e1_rt_bigint_stack.cpp` with C++26: auto, std::span, std::ranges, static_cast
- Unified C++/LLVM compiler replacing separate backends:
  - `e1_compile.cpp` (112 lines) + `e1_preamble.hpp` (85 lines)
  - Single `Gen` struct with `L` flag for backend selection
  - Removed old heap-based bigint runtime
- Stack-based bigint runtime (`e1_rt_bigint_stack.cpp`):
  - No heap allocation — all buffers on stack via `alloca`
  - Uses `llvm.stacksave`/`llvm.stackrestore` in loops to prevent stack exhaustion
- Updated docs/IMPLEMENTATIONS.md and README.md with new benchmarks
- Created `docs/DESIGN.md` documenting design decisions
- Aligned e0peg.koka to e1peg.koka structure
- Added `make test` target: 25 tests across 5 implementations
- Fixed e1peg.koka and e1.koka bugs
- Added ARG_COUNT and INT_BITS configuration parameters
- Moved Koka into podman container
- Added `arg1` and `arg2` built-in variables
- Added `bench-1` Makefile target
- Added LLVM IR compiler with configurable bit width
- Added `@tag` syntax to PEG grammar
- Simplified `e0.peg` and `e0peg.koka`
- Renumbered grammar levels: e0..e5 → e1..e6
- True single-phase interpreter: `e1peg.koka`
- Added packrat memoization to `peg.koka`
- Organized project files into `src`, `examples`, `docs` directories
- Created `peg_test.koka` test suite (30/30 pass)
- PEG parser specification (`PEG_SPEC.md`)
- Seven levels of grammar variants (e0 through e6)
