# Design Decisions

## Language Progression (e0 through e6)

### Philosophy
Each level is *almost* a strict superset of the previous. This allows:
- Studying what each feature adds to expressiveness
- Demonstrating how higher-level features can be emulated with lower-level primitives
- Incremental implementation complexity

A strict superset was the original rule. It is deliberately broken in a few
places where keeping a low-level construct would be too ugly at higher
levels (see "Superset deviations" below).

### Superset deviations

Pragmatic, deliberate breaks of the superset rule (surfaced by the
differential-fuzzing work, see [FUZZING.md](FUZZING.md)):

| Levels | Deviation | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| e1 → e2 | `break_ifz` dropped | Effective as e1's minimal conditional primitive (Minsky machine), but too ugly once `case` + `break` exist |
| e3 → e4 | `case` requires a scrutinee | e4's pattern matching needs `case expr { pattern -> ... }`; the guard form `case { cond -> ... }` no longer parses |

Consequences:
- e1 programs that use loops do not parse at level 2+ (e.g. `examples/factorial.e1`).
- e2/e3 programs that use `case` do not parse at level 4.
- e2 → e3 is (so far) a true superset: all e2 examples run unchanged on e3peg.

### Level Rationale

| Level | Adds | Why Here |
|-------|------|----------|
| e0 | Sequential only (`+`, `-`) | Baseline: not Turing-complete, no control flow |
| e1 | `loop`, `break_ifz` | Minimal Turing-completeness (Minsky machine) |
| e2 | `case`, `break`, `* / %`, comparisons | Practical imperative programming |
| e3 | Booleans, callables, case expressions | First-class functions, proper boolean type |
| e4 | Arrays, pattern matching | Compound data, destructuring |
| e5 | Records, unit | Named fields, void/unit value |
| e6 | Static typing, type definitions | Type safety, user-defined types |

### Why e0 is Not Turing-Complete
Intentionally excludes loops to show the jump from "calculator" to "computer." Demonstrates that arithmetic alone (without unbounded iteration) cannot express general computation.

### Why e1 is the Turing Threshold
The combination of:
1. Unbounded integers (counters)
2. Increment/decrement (`+`, `-`)
3. Zero-test with conditional jump (`break_ifz`)

This is exactly a 2-counter Minsky machine, proven Turing-complete by Minsky (1967).

### Emulation Principle
Each level's example file demonstrates encoding the *next* level's features using only current primitives:
- e1 emulates `case`, `break`, `*`, `/`, `<` from e2
- e2 emulates booleans and simple callables from e3
- etc.

This shows the features are conveniences, not fundamental extensions to computational power (after e1).

## Control Flow: `break_ifz` vs `when` loops

### The Question
Should e1 use `break_ifz expr` (break if zero) or `when expr stmt` (loop while non-zero)?

### Comparison

| Pattern | `break_ifz` | `when` |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Loop while n>0 | `loop { break_ifz n; body }` | `when n { body }` |
| If-then | `loop { break_ifz c; action; break_ifz 0 }` | `when c { action; c := 0 }` |
| Unconditional break | `break_ifz 0` | (not expressible) |
| Multi-condition exit | `break_ifz a; break_ifz b` | (not expressible) |

### Decision: `break_ifz`

Reasons:
1. **More primitive** — `loop` + `break_ifz` are orthogonal; `when` combines them
2. **More expressive** — supports early exit, multi-condition exits, and if-then without mutation
3. **Aligns with Minsky machines** — the zero-test is the fundamental conditional primitive

The `when` construct would save ~1 line per simple loop but loses expressiveness for complex control flow (e.g., GCD's triple exit: `break_ifz a; break_ifz b; break_ifz a - b`).

### Trade-off
The "if-then" idiom is verbose:
```
loop {
  break_ifz condition
  action
  break_ifz 0
}
```
But it doesn't require mutating the condition variable, unlike `when`.
